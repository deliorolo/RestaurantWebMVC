</p>

<p>This application has been developed by Délio Rolo and it is being updated regularly.</p>
<p>It has the function to assist in the control and management of production in a restaurant business.</p>
<p>It consists of an ASP .NET MVC application and a WebAPI service.</p>
<p>It has the possibility to access data through direct connection to a database or by consuming the WebAPI service included in the same solution, connected to a different database. In both approaches was used Entity Framework.</p>
<p>To switch between approaches, it is necessary to change the code of RestaurantWeb in Global.asax line 17 "Connection.******" ("Direct" Vs "WebApi")</p>
